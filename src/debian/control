Description: Daemon for IPP over USB printer support
 ipp-usb is a userland driver for USB devices (printers, scanners, MFC),
 supporting the IPP over USB protocol. It enables these USB devices to
 be seen as regular network printers.
 .
 It is designed to be a replacement of ippusbxd daemon, previously
 used for this purpose. It has a greatly rethought architecture, in
 comparison with ippusbxd, and fixes all of its major flaws and issues.
